# How To Run
Navigate to the 'plants' folder and open index.html. Open this in a web browser of your choice (though Google Chrome may be buggy). This will generate a cool spiral upon opening! 

If you want it saved, change the "SAVE" variable to 'true' in the top. This will download the image into your browser's default download location.

Sometime this has trouble working in Google Chrome, so I recommend opening it in FireFox.

# Have some fun
There is a lot of stuff going on in flower_generator.js. I hope to make it pretty. If you feel like it, have fun changing some variables.
